## Mac Users, install XCode

You need to install XCode so that you have some basic command line tools which are not available by default when buying a Mac.

Click on the ï£¿ at the top left of your screen and open the App Store. Search for `XCode`, and download it. It is pretty big, so don't do it while tethering...

Once it is downloaded and installed, go to the next step.
