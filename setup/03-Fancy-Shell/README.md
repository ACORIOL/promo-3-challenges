## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your terminal

When launching your terminal, you are running a shell, which is waiting for your commands, such as:

```shell
ls
```

which list the files of the current directory.

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one. Open your terminal and run:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh
```

On Mac, open Terminal -> Preferences and set the "Pro" theme as default. Quit and relaunch the terminal.
