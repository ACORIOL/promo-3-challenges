## Homebrew, Mac's missing Package Manager

If you are running Ubuntu, skip this step, you already have the command `apt-get` to install all the software you'll need.

On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). To do so, open your terminal and run:

```shell
ruby <(curl -fsS https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)
```

Then install some useful software:

```shell
brew install vim git node
```
