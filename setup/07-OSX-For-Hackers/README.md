## OSX For Hackers

If you are running Ubuntu, you can skip this step.

You want a fast keyboard, so run this in your terminal:

```shell
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 2
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 15
```

You can have a look at [this](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) and run whichever command you see fit.
