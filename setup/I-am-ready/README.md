## Ready?

To show the team you are done with setting up your laptop, open your terminal, run the commands on the right to place yourself in the `I-am-ready` directory, then run the ones below:

```
touch SETUP_COMPLETED
git add SETUP_COMPLETED
git commit --message "My laptop rocks :)"
git push origin master
```

Thank you! You are ready to start the ruby module!
